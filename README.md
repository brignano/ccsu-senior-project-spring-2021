## Background Information
When signifigant damage occurs to an automobile that is insured by The Hartford, our policyholder looks to us to compensate them for these damages. This process requires The Hartford to obtain a lot of information related to that incident in order to successfully and efficiently process our policyholders insurance *claim*.

> A car insurance claim is a report you file after a collision with another vehicle or another circumstance resulting in damage to your vehicle. A claim usually results in a payment from your auto insurance company, which kicks in after you meet your deductible. _[[source](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/car-insurance-claims/#:~:text=When%20to%20File%20a%20Car%20Insurance%20Claim&text=A%20car%20insurance%20claim%20is,after%20you%20meet%20your%20deductible.)]_

*This is what we refer to as our "Claims" process in Personal Lines insurance.*

## Project Description
Our goal this semester will be to create an application that provides an optimized (and responsive) user experience to our policyholders and enable The Hartford to collect all the required information for a car insurance claim.

## Project Scope
_For a more detailed technical overview please refer to [Scope.md](Scope.md)._

Create an application with 3 key components:
1. Frontend
    - Collect required claim data
        - Policy Number
        - Location (Address)
        - Category of Claim (see iii.org for the 6 categories)
        - Description of Claim
2. Backend
    - READ from database
    - WRITE to database
    - Integrate a third-party API call (Google Geocode API)
3. Database
    - Store claims data

## Project Challenges
How many people have:
* Created a database?
* Developed a frontend?
* Developed a backend?
* Deployed an application to the cloud?
* Integrated a frontend with a backend?
* Integrated a third-party API?

These points will be the crux of this project for you.

## Constraints & Assumptions
* Students will only be able to leverage open source/free tools and software.
* [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) can be leveraged by students for free cloud infrastructure.

## Sponsor-Provided Hardware And Software
* No hardware or software will be provided by The Hartford.
* The team is expected to leverage open source software that is available to students for learning.

## Sponsor And Project Specific Deliverables
* Team will provide weekly status update with walk through on what was accomplished and the task ahead for the upcoming week.
* Documentation (before any development can begin) on tools & software the team will use for this initiative.
* Occasional Code walkthrough of the source code as requested by The Hartford team.
* Final Presentation document at the end of the Project with a walk through with our senior leadership team.

## Proprietary Information
* Any documentation describing systems shared by The Hartford is considered proprietary. It should never be copied or shared with anyone outside of the project team.
* Any internal URL’s that are shared for this project should never be shared outside of the project team.
