# Sprint 4 
## Innovation Sprint

> Great work! You have successfully created a full-stack application that consumes data from a third-party API *(Google Geocoding API)*.
>
> So what's next? **You tell us.**

## Food for thought,
- Deploy your application to [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
- Add ability to autocomplete the address as the user is typing (see [Google Maps API Places Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete))
- Add ability to attach an additional document (i.e. image) to the claim (and store in database)
- Implement HIG UX KIT styling _(see [References.md#frontend](https://brignano.github.io/ccsu-senior-project-spring-2021/References.html#frontend))_
- Anything else you can think of...
